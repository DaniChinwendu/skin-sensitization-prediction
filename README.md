## Overview

This repository contains code for analyzing molecular fingerprints and predicting skin sensitization using machine learning models.

## Features

- **Conjugation Analysis**: Detect and analyze conjugated systems in molecules
- **Fingerprint Visualization**: Visualize Morgan and AtomPair fingerprint bits
- **Similarity Analysis**: Compute Tanimoto similarity matrices with multiple fingerprint types (Morgan, MACCS, AtomPair, PubChem)
- **Model Training**: Train and evaluate KNN and Random Forest classifiers with cross-validation and SHAP analysis
